# Student Marks Prediction using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Description
This project predicts student marks based on the number of hours studied using a Machine Learning model (Linear Regression).

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Google Colab
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib

## 📊 How It Works
- The model is trained on past data of study hours and marks
- It learns the relationship using Linear Regression
- It predicts marks for new study hours entered by the user

## ▶️ How to Run
1. Open the notebook in Google Colab
2. Run all cells
3. Enter study hours when prompted
4. View predicted marks and graph

## 📈 Output
- Predicted marks based on input hours
- Graph showing study hours vs marks
